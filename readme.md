* Context-driven Pyramid Registration Network for Estimating Large Topology-preserved Deformation

# Introduction

Deep learning-based deformable image registration methods have become attractive alternatives to traditional methods because of their great performance and fast run time. However, it is still challenging for these methods to estimate large topology-preserved deformation, and the contextual information that is important for large deformation is also under-mined. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised context-driven pyramid registration network for estimating large topology-preserved deformation named CPRNet.

Implementation
===============

A tensorflow implementation of deep-learning-based registration.

* Requirements
  * OS : Window
  * Python 3.6
  * Tensorflow 1.14.0

# To be done
The paper is under review. In addition, we are developing a registration toolbox to deploy the liver and brain registration on the web.
